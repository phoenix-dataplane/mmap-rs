# mmap-rs

Rust API for memory-mapped file IO, providing fixed address memory mapping and aligned address memory mapping.
It provides `MmapFixed`, `MmapAligned` and a general `Mmap` utility for
finer-grained mmap flag control.

TODO:
- remove assertions in functions and returns Result/Error instead.
- add examples
